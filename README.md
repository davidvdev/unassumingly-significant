# Unassumingly Significant
A TTRPG generator project. This project is inspired by those times when players ask about unassuming details during a game. Made for GMs who love finding unexpected plot hooks (or advancing current ones) in improvisational ways.

- `What's in those boxes?`
- `Is there anything on the shelves?`
- `Would I recognize that person?`
- `What is that building next to the building we're supposed to be paying attention to?`
